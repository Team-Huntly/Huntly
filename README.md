## Description of Project 📝

#### Problem Statement: LFS02 - Social Cohesion

<br/>

## Idea 💡

#### Huntly

A cross-platform mobile application that brings people closer to the physical environment and forms meaningful connections by organising real-world Treasure Hunts for free and winning rewards. The app uses machine learning to match users and form teams of like-minded people. Users can choose from a wide variety of pre-set, themed clues or even create their own. Clues can be unlocked through QR code scanning or the answers are verified through location tracking. Users are encouraged to click pictures with their teammates and can view their pictures as memory threads.
